Proposed Project Idea: COVID-19 Statistics App

1.	As COVID-19 spreads, number of COVID-19 monitoring apps have been developed to aid in the pandemic's containment. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Many countries implemented measures to curb or mitigate the pandemic's impacts, including complete economic shutdowns. In India, there is no dedicated application for normal users to retrieve statistics about the current situation if he/she wants to get understanding about it. Daily around 100k people’s gets infected with covid19 virus in India. People belonging to rural areas find it hard to get the knowledge from the internet for many reasons. Sometimes the media misleads their audience with false data and these people don’t get to know the complete truth. So we are creating an application for users where they can get the up-to-date statistics about the covid19 cases and additional information regarding the pandemic.

2.	This application will help every user who are confused with so many different data related to the virus. Raj Kapoor belongs to a very rural region who uses his android phone to know about the statistics throughout the country which consists daily cases increased, total number of cases from the beginning, number of infected people who has been cured from the disease, number of deaths due to the disease and many more such data, number of people recovered from the deadly virus.

3.	Features – <br>
(1) In-depth information about the Covid 19 situation, including the number of reported cases, active cases, recovered patients, death count, samples analyzed, and the most recent time the information was updated, as well as a pie chart representation of active, recovered, and death cases. <br>
(2) Data can be viewed for individual states separately and also for different countries around the world to know the impact of this disease. <br>
(3)	When we are at home, we mostly use the Wi-Fi service. Assuming the user is outside his/her home, this application will remind the user to wear a mask for protection if he/she is disconnected from the Wi-Fi. <br>
(4)	It would have a feature to call and SMS emergency medical service in case of emergency.
(5) It will show the vaccine centers avaialble in the states of India.

4.	The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India) maintains a record that is updated on a regular basis. Existing covid 19 applications do not have detailed statistics for the entire covid 19 scenario. The API we are using in this application updates them based on state press bulletins, official chief minister's and health minister's social handles, Press trust of India. These are generally more recent. There are some applications on the market produced by individual Indian state governments, but they only show statistics for that state. For example, Covid-19 quarantine monitor, COVA Punjab.

5.	API’s and Libraries– <br>
(1)	covid19india.org for India specific API <br>
(2)	corona.lmao.ninja for global API <br>
(3)	Eaze graph for showing pie chart <br>
(4)	Glide for showing flag images <br>
(5) Volly Library for fetching data from JSON dataset
